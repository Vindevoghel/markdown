## A funny story

When I first met my current girlfriend, we went to a concert together and I got a locker to put our coats in. It was quite chilly by the time I realised:

    1. I lost the keys to the locker.
    2. There was no bus connection home.
    3. Uber doesn't exist here.
    

### TL;DR

I lose everything and will probably miss class at some point cause I either locked myself in or out of my apartment
